This is the website for the Rensselaer class *Impactful Innovators*.

Hi, I'm professor Jason Kuruzovich (you can use professor Jason or just Jason is fine), and I'm the director of the Severino Center for Technological Entrepreneurship.

We have a great set of speakers

For class this semester, thank you in advance for complying with RPI mask policies. The science is solid and we want to all get through the semester heathy and without incident.

Here is a quick reference for the systems that will be used in the class.  Please download the desktop copy of both Webex Meetings and Webex Teams via this [link](https://www.webex.com/downloads.html).

## Webex Meetings: Hybrid Class Streaming
We will be using Webex Meetings to stream all classes.  The course recordings be made available through this website.

## Webex Teams: Classroom and Asynchronous Discussions and Questions
I want to be very responsive to your questions and concerns as we go through the class.  Webex Teams *(NOT EMAIL)* is the best way to reach me.  I would suggest downloading the Webex Teams application for your phone and desktop.  Because Webex meeting chats do not persist, we are going to use the Webex Teams space for text discussions even when streaming from Webex meetings.

This semester could be challenging if you don't know others from the class and are working remotely.  Feel free to use this as a drop in space.  Create a meeting and collaborate with others.
