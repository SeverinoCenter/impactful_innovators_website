Hi, I'm professor Jason Kuruzovich (you can use professor Jason or just Jason is fine), and I'm the Director of the Severino Center for Technological Entrepreneurship.  Together with Kelly Reardon (who works with me in the Severino Center) we will be putting a new one credit class and open speaker series for the campus.  The goal is to introduce students to the variety of ways that innovators change the world, encouraging students with compelling stories from the lives of entrepreneurs. By featuring individuals directly involved with various aspects of the technology development and commercialization process, the class will help students project such stories onto their own lives, either working as an entrepreneur or intrapreneur.

We have a great set of speakers for this semester and we hope you are as excited about it as we are.

This speaker series is supported by NSF Award 1548000.
