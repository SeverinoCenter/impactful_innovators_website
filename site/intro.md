Hi, I'm professor Jason Kuruzovich (you can use professor Jason or just Jason is fine), and I'm the Director of the Severino Center for Technological Entrepreneurship.  Together with Kelly Reardon (who works with me in the Severino Center) we will be putting a new one credit class and open speaker series for the campus.  Our objective is to both try and create a community around entrepreneurship (making it a team sport) and inspire you to take a few steps in the shoes of an entrepreneur during your time at Rensselaer.

We have a great set of speakers for this semester and we hope you are as excited about it as we are.

This speaker series is supported by NSF Award 1548000.
